# Sponge-attack
A Sponge Attack is an adversarial technique that exploits resource-intensive operations to drain computational or memory resources in machine learning models, particularly in federated learning or resource-constrained systems.

# Defense in wearable
Hashing in watermarking for ML models ensures the secure embedding and verification of ownership marks by generating unique, tamper-resistant signatures for model integrity and provenance.
