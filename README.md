# Project Name
Energy-Latency Sponge Attack on Wearable AI


# Sponge-attack
A Sponge Attack is an adversarial technique that exploits resource-intensive operations to drain computational or memory resources in machine learning models, particularly in federated learning or resource-constrained systems.

# Defense in wearable
Hashing in watermarking for ML models ensures the secure embedding and verification of ownership marks by generating unique, tamper-resistant signatures for model integrity and provenance.

# Simulation Device
We simulate the experiment on the Ordoid N2. The Odroid N2 is a high-performance single-board computer (SBC) developed by Hardkernel, designed for applications requiring powerful processing capabilities in a compact form. Here are some key features and highlights:
